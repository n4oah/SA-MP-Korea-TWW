Changelog
---------
v2.6:
- Adjusted algorithm for searching cells that contain visible items,
  improving performance for players moving around the map frequently
- Greatly improved speed of spatial queries
- Implemented predictive streaming algorithm based on the player's
  current velocity and the average time between updates
- Replaced PAWN invoke system with Zeex's SA-MP GDK, improving
  overall performance
- Added functionality for preventing runtime errors due to outdated
  include files
- Added check for include file version in the plugin
- Fixed rare bug that sometimes stopped updates from occurring when
  Streamer_TickRate was used
- Changed interior check implementation to allow an unlimited number
  of interiors to be added per item, fixing the crash that occurred
  when players were in interior IDs 20 or above
- Changed virtual world check implementation for pickups to allow an
  unlimited number to be added
- Slightly improved streaming algorithm for pickups
- Made OnPlayerLeaveDynamicArea callbacks execute before
  OnPlayerEnterDynamicArea callbacks
- Added Streamer_ToggleIdleUpdate for allowing or disallowing updates
  to process for players who are not moving

  world ID and interior ID
- Added rotation parameters to MoveDynamicObject (SA-MP 0.3d only)
- Added IsDynamicObjectMoving

v2.3.6
